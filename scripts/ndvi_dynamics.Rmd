# NDVI Peak Dynamics

This workflow detects the length of time for NDVI to go from baseline to peak over the course of the year. Each pixel is classified with a value reflecting the length of time in the year for NDVI to reach peak greenness.

Notes:
 * Allow options for baseline-to-peak or baseline-to-baseline
 * Data sources: MODIS (primary), Landsat 8

## Load libraries
```{r load-libraries}
library(raster)
library(rgdal)
```

## Create functions
```{r functions}

```

## Load rasters
```{r load-rasters}


```

## Make an ordered time series of the rasters
```{r time-series-stack}

```

## Handle clouds
```{r handle-clouds}

```

## Trace NDVI over the year
```{r track-ndvi}

```

## Reclassify the raster based on the NDVI dynamics detected
```{r reclass-based-on-time-series}

```

## Plot the reclassified raster
```{r plot-result}

```
